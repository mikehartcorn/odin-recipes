    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the ultimate pancake recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium bowl, beat egg with wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining 
            ingredients just until flour is moistened (batter will be slightly lumpy); 
            do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in 
            additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk. </li>
        <li>Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375Â°F). (To test griddle, 
            sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just 
            right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray 
            before heating). </li>
        <li>For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 
            to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn; cook other 
            side until golden brown. </li>
    </ol>
